I am an MPhil student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), 
where I focus on developing and evaluating large-scale generative models.
Under the supervision of [Prof. Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/) and 
[Prof. Amin Gohari](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/gohari-amin/).

Previously, I graduated with a double major in **Computer Engineering** and **Applied Mathematics** from
[Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/). I also worked as a research assistant 
at [CUHK](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) and [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), building on prior research experience with [Prof. Mohammad Hossein Manshaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=33d716cAAAAJ).

My research interests include but are not limited to the following areas:
- **Machine Learning:** Generative Models (GANs, Diffusion Models, LLMs), Graph Neural Network, ML Theory
- **Applied Mathematics:** Algorithmic Graph Theory, Game Theory, Information theory, Approximation algorithms
