I am a Master of Philosophy student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
During my MPhil study I work under supervision of [Prof. Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/) 
and [Prof. Amin Gohari](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/gohari-amin/). working on training and evaluation of
largescale generative models. Previously, I was a double majoring graduate in **Computer Engineering** and **Applied Mathematics** at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir/).
Also I work as a research assistant at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) and [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
Previously I was an undergrad research assistant at The Game Theory and Mechanism Design Lab (GTMD) held by Prof. [Mohammad Hossein Manshaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=33d716cAAAAJ).

My research interests include but are not limited to the following areas:
- **Machine Learning:** Generative Models (GANs, Diffusion Models, LLMs), Graph Neural Network, ML Theory
- **Applied Mathematics:** Algorithmic Graph Theory, Game Theory, Information theory, Approximation algorithms
